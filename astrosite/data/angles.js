It indicates the qualities that a person may project onto others or seek in their partners, often reflecting aspects of themselves they don't readily acknowledge. The sign on the Descendant can reveal what an individual finds attractive in others and the type of people they tend to draw into their lives for close relationships. The Descendant also provides insight into how one navigates cooperation, compromise, and the balance between self and other. Understanding the Descendant helps individuals become more aware of their relationship patterns, projections, and the shadow aspects of their personality that they may initially only recognize in others.",
