    descriptionLong: "A Square is a challenging aspect in astrology that represents tension and conflict between two planetary energies. It often manifests as obstacles, difficulties, or areas of life that require significant effort to navigate. While Squares can be stressful, they are also powerful catalysts for growth and development. They provide the motivation and drive to overcome challenges and achieve goals. The friction created by a Square can lead to notable accomplishments if the energy is channeled constructively. However, if not managed well, Squares can result in frustration, inner conflict, and a tendency to resist necessary changes. The key to working with a Square is to embrace the challenges it presents as opportunities for personal growth and transformation.",

    descriptionShort: "A Sextile occurs when two planets are approximately 60 degrees apart in the birth chart.",
    descriptionLong: "A Sextile is a harmonious aspect in astrology that represents opportunities and potential for growth between two planetary energies. It often manifests as areas of life where there is ease of communication, learning, and cooperation. Sextiles offer gentle support and indicate where one can find opportunities for development if they choose to act on them. This aspect brings a sense of flow and natural talent, but unlike the more potent Trine, it requires some effort to fully utilize its benefits. The challenge with Sextiles is that their gentle nature can sometimes lead to complacency or a passive approach, causing opportunities to be missed. The key to maximizing a Sextile's potential is to actively engage with the energies it offers, taking initiative to develop the talents and opportunities it presents.",

    descriptionLong: "A Semisquare is a minor challenging aspect in astrology that represents a relationship of mild tension and irritation between two planetary energies. It often manifests as areas of life where there are recurring minor conflicts or a need for constant adjustments. While not as intense as a full Square, the Semisquare creates enough friction to prompt growth and change. This aspect can lead to feelings of restlessness or frustration, but it also serves as a catalyst for personal development. The challenges presented by a Semisquare are typically manageable but persistent, requiring ongoing effort to navigate. The key to working with a Semisquare is to recognize the growth potential in these minor irritations and use them as motivation for self-improvement and problem-solving.",

    descriptionLong: "A Semisextile is a minor aspect in astrology that represents a subtle connection and mild tension between two planetary energies. It often manifests as areas of life where there are gentle opportunities for growth and development, but these may be easily overlooked. The Semisextile creates a slight sense of friction or adjustment, which can serve as a mild stimulant for change and awareness. While not as obvious or powerful as major aspects, Semisextiles can indicate potential areas for personal development if consciously addressed. The challenge with this aspect is that its subtle nature can lead to its influence being ignored or its opportunities missed. The key to working with a Semisextile is to pay attention to these gentle nudges for growth and actively engage with the subtle connections it presents, turning mild tension into productive development.",

    descriptionShort: "A Septile occurs when two planets are approximately 51.43 degrees apart in the birth chart.",
    descriptionLong: "A Septile is a minor but spiritually significant aspect in astrology that represents a mystical or fated connection between two planetary energies. It often manifests as areas of life where one experiences intuitive flashes, spiritual insights, or a sense of divine inspiration. The Septile is associated with experiences that feel destined or beyond ordinary explanation, potentially leading to a sense of being guided by a higher power. This aspect can bring creative inspiration and unique perceptions, but it may also lead to feelings of being out of sync with the mundane world. The challenge with Septiles is integrating these spiritual or intuitive experiences into everyday life, as they can be difficult to explain or understand rationally. The key to working with a Septile is to remain open to spiritual guidance and intuitive insights while maintaining a grounded perspective to avoid potential delusions.",
