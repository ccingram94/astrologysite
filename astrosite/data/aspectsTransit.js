    descriptionShort: "An Opposition occurs when two planets are approximately 180 degrees apart in the birth chart.",
    descriptionLong: "An Opposition is a major aspect in astrology that represents a relationship of tension and potential balance between two planetary energies. It often manifests as a need to find equilibrium between opposing forces or viewpoints. This aspect can bring increased awareness and objectivity, as well as the ability to see both sides of a situation. However, it can also lead to internal conflict, indecision, or a tendency to project one's own issues onto others. The key to working with an Opposition is to find ways to integrate and balance the energies involved, rather than letting them polarize or create ongoing tension.",

    descriptionLong: "A Sextile is a harmonious aspect in astrology that represents opportunities and potential for growth between two planetary energies. It often manifests as areas of life where there is ease of communication, learning, and cooperation. Sextiles offer gentle support and indicate where one can find opportunities for development if they choose to act on them. This aspect brings a sense of flow and natural talent, but unlike the more potent Trine, it requires some effort to fully utilize its benefits. The challenge with Sextiles is that their gentle nature can sometimes lead to complacency or a passive approach, causing opportunities to be missed. The key to maximizing a Sextile's potential is to actively engage with the energies it offers, taking initiative to develop the talents and opportunities it presents.",

    descriptionLong: "A Semisquare is a minor challenging aspect in astrology that represents a relationship of mild tension and irritation between two planetary energies. It often manifests as areas of life where there are recurring minor conflicts or a need for constant adjustments. While not as intense as a full Square, the Semisquare creates enough friction to prompt growth and change. This aspect can lead to feelings of restlessness or frustration, but it also serves as a catalyst for personal development. The challenges presented by a Semisquare are typically manageable but persistent, requiring ongoing effort to navigate. The key to working with a Semisquare is to recognize the growth potential in these minor irritations and use them as motivation for self-improvement and problem-solving.",

The Semisextile creates a slight sense of friction or adjustment, which can serve as a mild stimulant for change and awareness. While not as obvious or powerful as major aspects, Semisextiles can indicate potential areas for personal development if consciously addressed. The challenge with this aspect is that its subtle nature can lead to its influence being ignored or its opportunities missed.

    descriptionLong: "A Septile is a minor but spiritually significant aspect in astrology that represents a mystical or fated connection between two planetary energies. It often manifests as areas of life where one experiences intuitive flashes, spiritual insights, or a sense of divine inspiration. The Septile is associated with experiences that feel destined or beyond ordinary explanation, potentially leading to a sense of being guided by a higher power. This aspect can bring creative inspiration and unique perceptions, but it may also lead to feelings of being out of sync with the mundane world. The challenge with Septiles is integrating these spiritual or intuitive experiences into everyday life, as they can be difficult to explain or understand rationally. The key to working with a Septile is to remain open to spiritual guidance and intuitive insights while maintaining a grounded perspective to avoid potential delusions.",
