    descriptionShort: "The Ascendant represents how one projects themselves to the world, influencing appearance, behavior, and first impressions.",
    descriptionLong: "The Ascendant, also known as the rising sign, is the zodiac sign that was ascending on the eastern horizon at the time of birth. It represents the way an individual presents themselves to the world, influencing physical appearance, mannerisms, and initial reactions to new situations. The Ascendant acts as a 'mask' or 'persona', often describing the first impression one gives to others. It also governs the physical body and overall approach to life. The sign and any planets near the Ascendant significantly impact one's appearance and how they are perceived by others. The Ascendant is considered one of the most important points in a natal chart, along with the Sun and Moon signs, as it provides insight into how an individual interacts with their environment and projects their personality to the world.",
