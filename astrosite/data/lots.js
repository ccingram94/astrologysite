    description: "The most important of the lots, representing one's fortune, physical body, and material circumstances, the Lot of Fortune acts as a secondary Ascendant and is crucial in determining the native's general well-being and prosperity. In traditional practice, it serves as a primary indicator for physical health conditions, significant life changes involving resources or property, and times of notable good fortune or challenge in the material realmâ€”such as inheritance, financial windfalls, or periods of material hardship. This lot is particularly activated during major life transitions involving the body or material circumstances, such as relocations, career changes affecting income, health crises or recoveries, and it was traditionally used to time important initiatives related to business ventures, medical procedures, or any endeavor requiring physical stamina or material resources. Ancient astrologers considered its position and condition essential for determining the overall 'luck' or 'fortune' of the native, using it to assess everything from athletic ability and physical vitality to the likelihood of accumulating wealth and maintaining good health throughout life.",
