        Domicile: "When Saturn is in Capricorn or Aquarius, it operates at full strength. Capricorn and Aquarius are Saturn's natural homes, where its qualities of discipline, structure, and long-term planning are expressed with authority. In Capricorn, Saturn emphasizes ambition, responsibility, and mastery over material goals. In Aquarius, Saturn focuses on innovation, social order, and creating progress within boundaries. Individuals with Saturn in these signs excel in building lasting structures and achieving their goals through hard work, but in Capricorn, they may need to avoid becoming too rigid or work-obsessed, and in Aquarius, they should be mindful of being detached or overly inflexible in their ideals.",
        Exaltation: "Saturn is exalted in Libra, where its energies of fairness, discipline, and responsibility merge harmoniously with Libra’s focus on balance and justice. In Libra, Saturn thrives in creating long-lasting partnerships, fairness in relationships, and achieving societal harmony. Individuals with Saturn in Libra are natural peacemakers and mediators, excelling at creating stability in interpersonal or professional relationships. However, they should guard against being overly focused on perfection or fearing disapproval in social settings.",
        Detriment: "Saturn is in detriment in Cancer and Leo, where its structured, disciplined qualities are challenged by these signs' tendencies toward emotional expression and individuality. In Cancer, Saturn’s desire for boundaries and control may conflict with Cancer’s emotional and nurturing focus, making it difficult for individuals to process emotions or accept vulnerability. In Leo, Saturn’s reserved nature is overshadowed by Leo’s need for self-expression and recognition, potentially leading to struggles with self-confidence or balancing humility with ambition. Growth comes from integrating emotional wisdom and creative expression into Saturn’s discipline.",
        Fall: "Saturn is in its fall in Aries, where its cautious and disciplined energy is at odds with Aries’ impulsive and action-oriented nature. In Aries, Saturn may struggle to assert itself without hesitation, as it prefers careful planning to Aries’ spontaneous drive. Individuals with Saturn in Aries may feel frustrated when their need for structure collides with their desire for immediate results. Once they learn to balance patience with boldness, they can channel their energy effectively toward long-term success."
